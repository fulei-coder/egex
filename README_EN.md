## Overview

This project implements a complete imitation learning pipeline for the **RealMan RM65 6-DOF robot arm with a custom Modbus gripper**, built on the HuggingFace LeRobot framework. It supports teleoperation data collection via HTC Vive Tracker and training/deployment of multiple state-of-the-art policies including **ACT, Diffusion Policy, VQ-BeT, SmolVLA, and Pi0**.

### Key Features

- 🎮 **Vive Teleoperation**: Low-latency teleoperation via OpenVR, with teaching mode fallback
- 📷 **Dual Camera System**: RealSense top + wrist cameras for global and fine-grained observation
- 🔧 **Async Modbus Gripper**: Non-blocking gripper control that doesn't affect control frequency
- 🧠 **Multi-Policy Support**: One dataset, multiple policy comparisons
- ⚡ **Optimized Inference**: EMA smoothing + deadzone filtering + temporal ensemble

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Humble2Full/lerobot-realman-vla.git
cd lerobot-realman-vla
bash setup.sh

# Collect data
python scripts/collect_data.py --arm-ip <YOUR_ARM_IP> --save-dir data/raw --fps 30

# Convert to LeRobot format
python scripts/convert_to_lerobot.py \
    --input-dir data/raw \
    --output-dir data/lerobot \
    --repo-id lerobot/pick_cube_30fps \
    --fps 30 \
    --task "pick up the cube and place it in the basket"

# Train (ACT recommended for beginners)
bash scripts/train.sh act

# Inference
python scripts/inference.py \
    --model outputs/act_realman/checkpoints/100000/pretrained_model \
    --arm-ip <YOUR_ARM_IP> \
    --freq 30
```

- All algorithm implementations (ACT, Diffusion Policy, VQ-BeT, SmolVLA, Pi0) come from LeRobot's built-in modules

### Collaboration

The initial Vive Tracker teleoperation code in `scripts/collect_data.py` was co-developed with a lab colleague. Subsequent refactoring (teaching mode, dual-camera support, data formatting) was done by the project author.
